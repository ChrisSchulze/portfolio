When we rebranded the DHB their new website was already in the making. The design was a mess and the information architecture was obscure.

If we wanted to make a difference we had to be quick. We agreed to work in three one-week sprints and see what we could come up with.

I developed a look & feel bringing the new font and layout pattern to exemplary modules. Also I revised the sitemap and came up with one that has less depth and brings player and game scores up front.

I’m glad we could improve some of the sites UX and design flaws. Wish we could have developed the whole site though…
