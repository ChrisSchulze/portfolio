### Issue

<p class="lead">When we rebranded the DHB their new website was already in the making. The design was a mess and the information architecture was obscure.</p>

### Approach

If we wanted to make a difference we had to be quick. We agreed to work in three one-week sprints and see what we could come up with.

### Solution

I developed a look & feel bringing the new font and layout pattern to exemplary modules. Also I revised the sitemap and came up with one that has less depth and brings player and game scores up front.

### One more thing

I’m glad we could improve some of the sites UX and design flaws. Wish we could have developed the whole site though…
