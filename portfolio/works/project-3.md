### Issue

When we rebranded the DHB their new website was already in the making. The design was generic and the information architecture needed improvement.

### Approach

<p class="einleser">If we wanted to make a difference we had to be quick. We agreed to work in three one-week sprints and see what we could come up with in that time period.</p>

### Solution

I developed a look & feel bringing the new font and layout pattern to exemplary modules. Also I revised the sitemap and came up with one that has less depth and brings player and game scores up front.

### One more thing

I’m glad we could improve some of the sites UX and design flaws. I wish we could have developed the whole site though… It is always unsatisfying to let go of a half finished project.
