<Label class="label">Issue</Label>

Severe weather often resulted in overloads of the online booking service. If you could reach it it was difficult to use because the user flow had flaws. Also the overall design needed improvement.

<Label class="label">Approach</Label>

For the self service a validated UX was key. We went through several iterations of prototypes. In each step we tested our assumptions in lab tests with our target audiences. Afterwards we reworked user flows, improved wording and design. Until we got it right.

<Label class="label">Solution</Label>

For the funnel we came up with a onepager checkout. It is easier to use, faster, more flexible and robust than the old one. We were able to improve the scheduling as well. Today we can assure bookings directly.

<Label class="label">Design Idea</Label>

For the corporate site we followed the idea that **„Carglass is always close**“. Therefore we heavily rely on location based services. Regarding imagery we chose to shoot close ups of customer service and clients.

<Label class="label">One more thing</Label>

When TNS Kantar checked the sites brand fit in 2017 it had the best score of all of carglass' touchpoints at that time. Which made us especially proud. Unfortunately Carglass chose to implement a new branding shortly after. One year after launch the site had to be skinned. So I chose to focus on merging the disciplines of UX and branding in my future work.
