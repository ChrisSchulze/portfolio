Issue

Severe weather often resulted in overloads of the booking service. The funnel was difficult to use and the design deeded improvement.

Approach

For the self service validated UX was key. We went through several iterations of prototypes. In each step we reworked user flows, improved wording and design. Until we got it right.

For the funnel we came up with a onepager checkout. It is easier to use, faster, more flexible and robust than the old one. We were able to improve the scheduling as well. Today we can assure bookings directly.

For the corporate site we followed the idea that **„Carglass is always close**“. Visually and technichal wise we heavily relied on location based services.

When TNS Kantar checked the sites brand fit in 2017 it had the best score of all of carglass touchpoints at that time.
