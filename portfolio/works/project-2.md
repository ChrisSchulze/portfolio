# A broken Service

Severe weather often resulted in overloads of the booking service. The funnel**â€™**s ux and the overall design needed improvement.

For the self service validated UX was key. We went through several iterations of prototypes, reworked userflows and improved wording and design. Until we got it right.

We came up with a onepager checkout. It is easier to use, faster, more flexible and robust than the old one. We were able to improve the scheduling as well**:** Today we can assure bookings directly.
