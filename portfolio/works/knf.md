### Issue

<p class="lead">In the past KNFs digital services had grown like sprawl: Lots of touchpoints, lots of differing product data, lots of people involved but no clear purpose behind.</p>

### Approach

We held stakeholder workshops with participants from all over the world to get everyone aligned on a mission: To build a single source of truth for their product data and to give the company a "face" to the outside world.

### Solution

We built a product information system and a shop-alike digital touchpoint for internal and external usage. To spread KNFs excitement for technology and empower their employer branding we built a corporate site.

### One more thing

Next up is a tool to facilitate collaboration. We want to enable service and customer to work together in an online platform for product development.
