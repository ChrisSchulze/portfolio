### Issue

<p class="einleser">In the past KNF's digital services had grown like sprawl: Lots of touchpoints, lots of differing product data, lots of people involved and no clear purpose.</p>

:categories="$page.frontmatter.categories"

### Approach

<p class="einleser">We held stakeholder workshops with participants from all over the world to get everyone aligned on a mission: To build <span class="bold">a single source of truth</span> for their product data and to give the company a "face" to the outside world.</p>

### Solution

We built a product information system and a shop-alike digital touchpoint for internal and external usage. To spread KNFs excitement for technology and empower their employer branding we built a corporate site.

### One more thing

Next up is a tool to facilitate collaboration. We want to enable service and customer to work together in an online platform for product development.
