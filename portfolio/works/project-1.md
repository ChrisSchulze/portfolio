Compos customer base was getting old. We saw an opportunity in a younger cohort and were assigned to come up with ideas.

We screened their touchpoints, checked the content and overall visual coherence and found they lacked recognisability and content strategy. They had to evolve if they wanted to close the gap.

We came up with a brand pattern that is highly recognisable. It consists of adaptive, leaflike structures. Content wise we went for gardening stories, knowledge and DIY manuals.

Unfortunately our proposal was not implemented. From design perspective this still is one of my favourite projects though.
