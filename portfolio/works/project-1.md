### Issue

<p class="lead">COMPO wanted to grow their customer base. We saw an opportunity in a younger cohort and were assigned to come up with ideas.</p>

### Approach

We screened COMPO's touchpoints, checked their content and overall visual coherence and found they lacked recognizability. Also they had no content strategy. They had to evolve if they wanted to close the gap.

### Solution

We came up with a brand pattern that consists of adaptive, leaflike structures. They can be used as text stages or backgrounds and are highly recognizable. Also I proposed a new set of fonts and a new image world. Regarding content strategy we went for gardening stories, knowledge and DIY manuals. Which lead to a their online shop.

### Outcome

Unfortunately our proposal was not implemented. From design perspective this still is one of my favourite projects though.
