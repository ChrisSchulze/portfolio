The museums lacked visibility. Finding them was difficult. Once you found them finding interesting exhibitions was even more difficult.

We held two workshops. First we took care of the branding. Second we looked after the visitor journey. We deviated the information architecture and UX Design from there.

To put the museums on the map we developed a logo system and a layout pattern derived from the museums floor plans. This reflects in the information architecture.

From experience I know exhibitions are most valuable if visitors can relate. That**â€™**s why we give the opportunity to browse exhibitions by subjective categories.
