### Issue

<p class="einleser">When we rebranded the DHB their new website was already in the making. The design was generic and the information architecture needed improvement.</p>

<SingleProjectHeader
:services="$page.frontmatter.services"
:year="$page.frontmatter.year.toString()"
:categories="$page.frontmatter.categories"
/>

### Approach

<p class="einleser">If we wanted to make a difference <span class="bold">we had to be quick.</span> We agreed to work in three one-week sprints and see what we could come up with in that time period.</p>

### Solution

I developed a look & feel bringing the new font and layout pattern to exemplary modules. Also I revised the sitemap and came up with one that has less depth and brings player and game scores up front.

### One more thing

Iâ€™m glad we could improve some of the sites UX and design flaws. Also we heightended the visual quality a lot. I still wish we could have developed the whole site though.
