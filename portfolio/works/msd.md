In the past KNFs digital services had grown like a sprawl: Lots of touchpoints, lots of differing product data, no clear purpose.

We held stakeholder workshops with participants from switzerland, china and the US to get everyone aligned on a mission**:** To build a single source of truth.

We built a product information system and a shop-alike digital touchpoint for internal and external usage. To spread KNFs excitement for technology and empower their employer branding we built a corporate site.

The next step is a tool to facilitate collaboration. We want to enable service and customer to work together in an online platform for product development.
