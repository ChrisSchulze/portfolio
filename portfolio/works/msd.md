### Issue

In the past KNFs digital services had grown like sprawl: Lots of touchpoints, lots of differing product data and no clear purpose behind.

### Approach

We held stakeholder workshops with participants from switzerland, china and the US to get everyone aligned on a mission**:** To build a single source of truth.

### Solution

We built a product information system and a shop-alike digital touchpoint for internal and external usage. To spread KNFs excitement for technology and empower their employer branding we built a corporate site.

### One more thing

Next up is a tool to facilitate collaboration. We want to enable service and customer to work together in an online platform for product development.
